AVTP Audio Format (AAF) Plugin
==============================

Overview
--------

The AAF plugin is a PCM plugin that uses Audio Video Transport Protocol (AVTP)
to transmit/receive audio samples through a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN)
capable network. The plugin enables media applications to easily implement AVTP
Talker and Listener functionalities.

Plugin Dependencies
-------------------

The AAF plugin uses libavtp to handle AVTP packetization. Libavtp source code
can be found in https://github.com/AVnu/libavtp as well as instructions to
build and install it. If libavtp isn't detected by configure, the plugin isn't
built.
